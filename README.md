# Tourist Sheba - MERN Stack Project  

## 🌍 Project Overview  

Welcome to the repository of my Travel Booking Site, a web application developed following @codingwithMuhib YouTube tutorial. This project is designed to offer users a seamless experience in browsing and booking travel tours.

Users can log in to their profiles, book tours, and leave reviews (stars and written feedback) for each trip.
